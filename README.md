# FSM Application

This project is a compilation of three different Finite State Machines (FSMs), each applied to either pattern matching or token analysis. Developed using JavaFX, the application provides a menu interface that allows users to select from three different tasks, each corresponding to a specific FSM.

The three FSMs included in the project are: Word Matching, Simple Real Number Validation, and Philippine Phone Number Validation.

### Word Matching
  This FSM checks whether an input word starts and ends with the substring 'and' and ensures that it is composed only of alphabetic characters.

### Simple Real Number Validation
  This FSM checks whether an input string represents a valid real number. It accounts for decimal points, signs, and digits, excluding any special characters other than decimal points and signs.

### Philippine Phone Number Validation
  This FSM validates whether an input string is a correctly formatted Philippine mobile phone number, considering both the standard prefixes (09xx or +63xx) and the total length of the number. The accepted formats are: 09xxxxxxxxx, +639xxxxxxxxx, 09xx-xxx-xxxx, and +639xx-xxx-xxxx.
